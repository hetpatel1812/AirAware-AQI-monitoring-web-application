## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This project builds upon several open-source technologies:

* Flask — web framework
* scikit-learn — machine learning toolkit
* Leaflet.js — interactive maps
* Chart.js — visualization engine
* Google Fonts & Material Symbols — UI assets

Development and refinement were assisted by AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. These tools were used strictly as development aids; final design and implementation decisions remain with the project author.

## 🚀 Deployment on Render

Follow these steps to host AirAware on [Render](https://render.com/):

### 1. Prepare your Repository
Make sure your code is pushed to a GitHub repository. The project already includes:
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies including `gunicorn`.
- `wsgi.py`: The entry point for the production server.
- `render.yaml`: Blueprint configuration for Render.

### 2. Connect to Render
1. Log in to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/).
2. Click **New +** and select **Blueprint**.
3. Connect your GitHub repository.
4. Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file and parse the configuration.

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
In the Render Blueprint setup, you will be prompted to provide values for:
- `NEWSDATA_API_KEY`: Your NewsData.io API key.
- `CPCB_API_KEY`: Your Central Pollution Control Board API key.

### 4. Deploy
1. Click **Apply**.
2. Render will build and deploy the application.
3. Once the build is complete, your app will be live at the provided `.onrender.com` URL.

> [!TIP]
> Use the **Free Tier** for hobby projects. If the app goes to sleep due to inactivity, the first request might take a few seconds to wake it up.
